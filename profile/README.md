## The ESA CIMR DEVALGO study

This page is the entry-point for the Level-2 ATBDs (Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document) produced by the ESA CIMR DEVALGO study.

The CIMR DEVALGO study is a 2-year ESA-funded study (2022-2024) funded to develop prototype ATBDs for a selection of CIMR Level-2 products.

### ATBDs

The Level-2 ATBDs developed by the CIMR DEVALGO study, sorted by Level-2 Product families, are:
* Polar Regions and Adjacent Seas:
   * [Level-2 Sea Ice Concentration, Sea Ice Edge, and SIC in NRT1H v1](https://cimr-algos.github.io/SeaIceConcentration_ATBD/intro.html) 
   * [Level-2 Sea Ice Drift v1](https://cimr-algos.github.io/SeaIceDrift_ATBD/intro.html)
   * [Level-2 Sea Ice Thickness v1](https://cimr-algos.github.io/SeaIceThickness_ATBD/intro.html)
   * [Level-2 Sea Surface Temperature v1](https://cimr-algos.github.io/SeaSurfaceTemperature_ATBD/intro.html) 
   * [Level-2 Sea Surface Salinity v1](https://cimr-algos.github.io/L2SSS/intro.html)
   * Level-2 Ocean Wind Vectors 
* Global Land:
   * [Level-2 Terrestrial Snow Area v1](https://cimr-algos.github.io/TerrestrialSnowArea_ATBD/intro.html)
   * Level-2 Soil Moisture

In addition, an [Ocean and Sea Ice Integrated Retrieval ATBD](https://cimr-algos.github.io/MultiParameter_ATBD/intro.html) is developed.

Repositories holding the content of the ATBDs are at the bottom of this page.

### Background

CIMR is the Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer mission, a multi-frequency, conically-scanning passive microwave imager
designed by ESA to support EU's Arctic Policy, among others. Its launch is scheduled in 2029.

### Objectives and Concept

CIMR DEVALGO develops selected CIMR Level-2 ATBDs in the form of [jupyterbooks](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html). The aim of the study is to:

> Provide baseline Level-2 retrieval Algorithm Theoretical Baseline Documents (ATBD)  - and supporting prototype software and validation data - for the CIMR Mission.

ATBDs are developed in two stages:
* v1 ATBDs describe the selected algorithm and expected input/output data streams.
* v2 ATBDs further describe the algorithm, add an open-source software prototype of the algorithm, and perform performance evaluation.

### The DEVALGO Team

The DEVALGO team is led by Thomas Lavergne from the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (NO). The consortium partners are the University of Bremen (DE),
the Danish Meteorological Institute (DK), IFREMER (FR), and the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FI).
